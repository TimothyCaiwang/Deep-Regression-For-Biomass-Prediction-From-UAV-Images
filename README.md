**Deep Regression For Biomass Prediction From UAV Images Using Pyhthon Scripts (Pytorch)**

We used six popular CNN networks (including ResNet-18/34/50, VGG-16, DenseNet, MobileNetV2) and two Transformer architectures (ViT and T2TViT) from Pytorch as the backbone for feature extraction. 
The last fully connected layer was changed to a linear regression layer so that the models were suitable for regression problems.

The workflow of deep regression models for predicting dry biomass from the UAV imagery with various band combinations is shown as follows:
